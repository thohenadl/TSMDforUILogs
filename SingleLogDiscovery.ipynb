    "# Time Series Motif Discovery for User Interaction Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data mining plays a crucial role in uncovering routines within user interaction logs. By analyzing sequences of user actions over time, data mining techniques can identify recurring patterns and behaviors. This allows us to understand how users typically navigate through a system, what actions they perform in sequence, and at what intervals. By uncovering these routines, we can gain valuable insights into user habits and preferences. This knowledge can then be used to optimize user interfaces, personalize experiences, and ultimately improve user satisfaction. For example, time series data mining might reveal a common sequence of actions users take to complete a specific task. This information could be used to streamline the process by suggesting the next step or automating repetitive actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionallity of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has three sections seperated into data preprocessing, Time Series Mining, and visualisation through Process Discovery.\n",
    "As with any Jupyter Notebook you can run each cell. For the method to properly work you have to setup the first cell after the library import accordingly. This cell contains the settings of the discovery approach. The attributes to be set are described in more detail before the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Section Preprocessing: In this section the necessery libraries are imported and the UI log is processed.\n",
    "2. Section Time Series Mining: The algorithm discovers the motifs based on the setup parameters.\n",
    "    - First, the UI log is encoded using our continuous hot encoding methodology.\n",
    "    - Second, if you set the parameter for window size calculation the window size will be calculated. Otherwise the specified window size is used.\n",
    "    - Third, the motif discovery is performed for the number of motifs you specified in the settings. \n",
    "3. The discovered motifs in the UI log are processed in a process discovery algorithm. The resulting directly follows graph is presented.\n",

In the Activity Window Tracking by Beerepoot et al. we considered the columns \"Title\" and \"App\".\n",

    "BreakTime >>> Int: Integer representing the number of seconds that are considered as a significant user break, e.g., lunch break or break between two UI log recording sessions. Set this parameter to exclude these breaks from the window size calculation. We recommend 300 seconds, i.e., 5 minutes, as an initial start value for breaks.\n",
